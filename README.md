Proximity tracing (proxtrax) with blazing fast speed, developed with the `embedded first` mindset.

Our benchmarks report that for 20.000 entries of DP3T Ephemeral IDs, ~5MB or RAM used and 0.02s of execution.

🚧 Pangolin is friend of the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu) about data-ownership and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). Our effort is that of improving people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create along [privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.
